# Calendar

This activity is a simple calendar planner that uses moment.js to display the current time, starting in business hours (9:00 am to 5:00 pm). Therefore the current time is displaying in different colors which indicate the time of the day (light green stands for past hours, orange stands for present and dark green for future hours). Each row represents a specific time with a text area to input a note. To  save the note you must click the save button (blue button) on the right. Then the information will be saved in the local storage of the page. This application runs in the browser and features dynamic ally updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
